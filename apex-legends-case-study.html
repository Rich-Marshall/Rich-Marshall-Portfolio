                        <h3 class="text-uppercase">Apex Legends Case Study</h3>
                        <strong>A look into the very succesful UX of Respawn's Apex Legends. This case study includes insights into the "Ping System", Movement and Feedback.</strong>
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>In the rapidly moving genre of Battle Royale games, innovation and new releases must distinguish themselves from the rest of the titles in the market. They must provide
                           a unique and rewarding experience in order to set themselves apart from what some would call a genre with extraordinarily little variety. In the case of Apex Legends, this was doubly the case as it was entering late
                           into an already saturated field, filled with titles such as: PUBG, Fortnite and COD: Blackout. Respawn and EA had a plan for this though and set an unprecedented unannounced, free, release on the 4th of February 2019.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>This caused enough of a stir to generate interest in the game while allowing the developers to update and modify as they went along with relatively low complaints from users. However, this approach raises another issue. While the fan base would be happy to allow Respawn to iron out any difficulties with the free release as the game developed, they would need the basis of the game and the core mechanics to be flawless.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p> <img  src="assets/img/apex-banner-image-1.png" alt="Title Image" class="center"/> </p>
                        <p> <strong> The Poblem </strong> </p>
                        <p>  Apex needed to “come out of the gate swinging” in order to impress the community with the base of the game, this would allow them to take some market share from other titles and then hopefully be able to retain the player base with good post release development. Releasing unannounced, free, did some of the work here for them.
                          Respawn needed a rewarding game structure to ensure players felt better playing Apex Legends than they did, the other titles in the genre. </p>
                        <p>  The first issue comes in the form of communication, as Apex is a class-based game allowing players to choose from a range of characters with special abilities that can work together, it is primarily a team game. This means players will have to communicate with other players on their three-man team.
                          The second comes in the form of player reward. The feedback a player gains from the game while playing must be good and make them want to play more.
                          The final problem in this genre is movement and inaccessible mechanics. Payers need to feel they have mastered the game and feel like they are not hindered by clunky mechanics, as these become frustrating and ultimately lead to a reduction in player count.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p> <strong> Users and Audience </strong> </p>
                        <p> Apex Legends fits nicely in the gap between Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) and Fortnite. PUBG is a more simulation style, shooter survival and Fortnite is a cartoony, building and shooting battle royale. Apex needed to appeal to the more casual gamer, than PUBG does, and had to appeal to players that wanted a more adult and shooter style game than Fortnite provides. </p>
                        <p> This demographic actually comprises the majority of players who play games in the genre. The key questions we have to ask ourselves here are A) how do we take the player base from other titles? And B) how do we retain them? </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p> <strong>Scope and Constraints </strong> </p>
                        <p>  When developing a project like Apex Legends, cost is of relatively low importance as long as the goals are reached, and player base can be retained. The goals set out needed to be to provide a meaningful and positive user experience by providing a system that felt complete on release that made players feel good about their own skills and gave large doses of positive affirmation from the game. </p>
                        <p>  Time was of more importance. The release time of Apex Legends needed to be right. At this time (4th Feb 2019), Battlefield V: Firestorm had already been announced for a hotly anticipated release on the 29th of March 2019. This meant Respawn and EA needed to ensure that Apex released before then and create enough noise to take the focus away from this release. The unannounced bomb drop release on the 4th of February did just that. </p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <h3>  Specific Features Developed </h3>
                        <strong>Look into three specific areas: Ping system, Movement, Feedback </strong>

                        <p> <h4>Ping System</h4> </p>
                        <p> <img  src="assets/img/apex-ping-system.png" alt="Ping System" class="center"/> </p>
                        <p>
                         Due to Apex’s format as a team-based game, communication is vital. A problem arises in that most players will not use voice chat when randomly paired with a team they don’t know.
                         This is where the “ping system comes in”. With a tap on the RB button on a controller a ping wheel can be brought up, which allows the player to use the thumbstick to select between a
                         variety of comments which can be directly related to what the player is seeing. It seamlessly allows the player to comment on any aspect of the game without having to actually speak.
                         Respawn has implemented this in a way which makes it easy to use and in fact, in some situations, easier than using voice communication. This being said it cannot completely replace voice which is a good thing as it allows those teams working together properly to have some communication edge over teams thrown together randomly. No other title in the genre has been able to recreate this to the standard that respawn has achieved.
                         </p>

                         <p> <h4> Movement</h4> </p>
                         <p> <img  src="assets/img/Apex Legends Slide Kill.gif" alt="Movement" class="center"/> </p>
                         <p>
                          Using Titanfall 2’s “Source” game engine allows respawn to create a seamless, fast paced gameplay that empowers the player to move around obstacles seamlessly
                          in a way that feels good. Other engines can create a clunky feel to games and Respawn have elected to use a less realistic feeling engine that makes the player feel like
                          their character is a superhero of sorts. This ties directly in with the player feedback goals that respawn set out.
                          </p>

                          <p> <h4>Feedback</h4> </p>
                          <p> <img  src="assets/img/Apex Armor BReak.gif" alt="Feedback" class="center"/> </p>
                          <p>
                           Feedback in games is especially important. It allows for positive reinforcement of certain actions and can give a negative response for other actions. The action of breaking another player’s armour causes a large cracking glass sound. This gives the player information and also a rush of dopamine. Respawn continues across the rest of the game with positive audio for healing item use and for kills. When the player gets a kill, the game floods the screen with an obvious visual and a kill counter. Information can be gained when a player kills you and their statistics can be viewed. This creates a very balanced gameplay and keeps players coming back for more and feeling good about their own skill.
                           </p>


                           <p> <h4>Outcomes</h4> </p>

                           <p>
                             This development approach proved to be very successful with Apex Legends gaining a big market share of users on release and being able to maintain these numbers, by providing the unique features outlined above, Respawn were able to keep the momentum and release more and more features to cement their place in the genre. This rapid development and free release paired with “Battle Pass” and “Loot Box” in game purchases has allowed them to continue to provide a free base game and still bring in enough funding to continue development. User feedback has been largely positive as a result of these features and Apex continues to be a market leader, even prompting other, previously more popular titles to adopt (or at least attempt to adopt) some of the popular features of the game.
                           </p>
